# The orininal Matlab code is written by Peter Kovesi.
# This python code is a translation of his Matlab code,
# therefore, it is kind of a derived code.
# So, here is his original copyright notice and usage comment
# (with a variable renaming from 'sze' to 'size'):

#  LOWPASSFILTER - Constructs a low-pass butterworth filter.
#
#  usage: f = Lowpassfilter(size, cutoff, n)
#
#  where: size    is a two element vector specifying the size of filter
#                to construct [rows cols].
#         cutoff is the cutoff frequency of the filter 0 - 0.5
#         n      is the order of the filter, the higher n is the sharper
#                the transition is. (n must be an integer >= 1).
#                Note that n is doubled so that it is always an even integer.
#
#                       1
#       f =    --------------------
#                               2n
#               1.0 + (w/cutoff)
#
#  The frequency origin of the returned filter is at the corners.
